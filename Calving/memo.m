% - 06/10/2021:  
% The subfolders have specific test, but in the main folder we have the tests TestLSF1d and
% TestLSF2d which use prescribed/analytical velocity and calving fields.
%
% The run in the subfolder 1dIceShelf is a nice simple test that works.
%   
% Both TestLSF1d and TestLSF2d run and provide good results.
