    % Define calving the Level-Set Field (LSF) and the Calving Rate Field (c)
    %
    % Both the Level-Set Field (LSF) and the Calving-Rate Field (c) must be defined over
    % the whole computational domain.
    % 
    %
    % The LSF should, in general, only be defined in the beginning of the run and set the
    % initial value for the LSF. However, if required, the user can change LSF at any time
    % step. The LSF is evolved by solving the Level-Set equation, so any changes done to
    % LSF in this m-file will overwrite/replace the previously calculated values for LSF.
    %
    % The calving-rate field, c, is an input field to the Level-Set equation and needs to
    % be defined in this m-file in each call.
    %
    % The variable F has F.LSF and F.c as subfields. In a transient run, these will be the
    % corresponding values from the previous time step.
    % 
    % If you do not want to modify LSF,  set
    %
    %   LSF=F.LSF
    %
    %
    % Also, if you do not want to modify c, you could in prinicple set
    %
    %   c=F.c
    %
    % However, note that in contrast to LSF, c is never evolved by Ãša.  (Think of c as an
    % input variable similar to the input as and ab for upper and lower surface balance,
    % etc.)
    %
    % Initilizing the LSF is the task of the user and needs to be done in this m-file.
    % Typically LSF is defined as a signed distance function from the initial calving
    % front position. There are various ways of doing this and you might find the matlab
    % function
    % 
    %   pdist2
